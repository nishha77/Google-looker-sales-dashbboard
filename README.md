4. To develop skills in creating insightful reports and dashboards.

**Tools and Technologies Used:**

• SQL: Database creation, querying, and aggregation. o Extracted data using JOIN, GROUP BY, and advanced filtering.

• Python: Data processing with Pandas for cleaning and transformation. Visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn for detailed insights.

• Google Looker Studio: Created interactive dashboards with real-time filters and drill-down capabilities. Integrated SQL-based data for visualization and easy sharing with stakeholders.

**Activities and Tasks**

1.Sales Decrease Analysis:

• Gathered sales data for the "Others" category for 2021 and 2022.
